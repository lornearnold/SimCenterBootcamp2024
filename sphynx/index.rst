Welcome to the NHERI-SimCenter 2024 Programming Bootcamp
========================================================

Following the success of our online version of this workshop,
this year's **offering will be solely online**.  Expect to collaborate with 
students from across the globe and enjoy the opportunity to make new friends
at unexpected places.

**The format** of the course this year **has changed** from previous offerings.
This year, the workshop is a **one week** intensive course of online instruction.
The course is split evenly into **Python** (M-T-W) and **C/C++** (W-Th-F).
The participants
will be asked to review video material before the workshop.
Each day, the material presented in those videos will
be reviewed **briefly** before example programs are developed from scratch.


.. note::
   
   It is **intense**. While instruction is limited to six hours a day, expect to spend a few extra hours daily working on assignments if you intend to get anything worthwhile from the courses.



The outline of the  workshop is follows.

1. Python Workshop

   * **July 29-31, 2024, 2.5 days**

   The first part of the Python training is geared towards beginner and intermediate level material.
   In it we will cover the basic concepts of python, as well as fundamentals of code design.
   It will utilize Python notebooks to achieve this. In the latter part of the workshop we will transition you
   to the command-line use of python. In it we will cover creating a modular python program, utilizing for example development
   environments and file editors, things you'll need working on any high-performance computing (HPC) environment. 

   
2. C/C++/HPC Workshop 

   * **July 31 - Aug 2, 2024, 2.5 days**

   The second half of this bootcamp is all done on a HPC target environment. We will start by
   reviewing coding basiscs in C and C++, but quickly transitioning to the fundamentals of
   parallel programming.  This is a highly intensive crash course which introduces attendees to
   concepts of computing, and quickly goes through fundamentals of coding in C and C++ to build
   applications that run in parallel. The particpants will be logging on to the TACC HPC resources,
   developing C and C++ applications, compiling these programs and then running the built applications
   on some of the fastest computers in the world.

.. note::

   Course material is available through 
   the `NHERI-SimCenter/SimCenterBootcamp2024 <https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/SimCenterBootcamp2024>`_
